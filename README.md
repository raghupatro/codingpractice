# codingpractice

## contains solutions to the coding problems I practice this summer

## Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet : [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_W5frvfC_dwlwIWayRa1tb3Qs28LlqIkMceh3MUUprY/edit?usp=sharing)

## running instructions

- clone this directory if needed
- setup launch.json if using vscode

### template.cpp

- uses input.txt and output.txt files as input and output respectively, unless run on an online judge
- change path to those files, as required on your pc
- my personal template, will make changes as required

## about the solutions

- _most solutions just needed an implementation of a particular function, only check the required functions in the uploaded solution, as the driver code isn't implemented._
