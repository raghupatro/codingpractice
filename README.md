## contains solutions to the coding problems I practice this summer

## Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet : [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_W5frvfC_dwlwIWayRa1tb3Qs28LlqIkMceh3MUUprY/edit?usp=sharing)

## 450DSA : [link](https://450dsa.com/)

## running instructions

- clone this repository, if needed
- setup launch.json for debugging in VS Code according to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference).

### template.cpp

- uses input.txt and output.txt files as input and output respectively, unless run on an online judge
- set path to those files, as required on your pc
- my personal template, will make changes as required

## about the solutions

- **most solutions just needed an implementation of a particular function, only check the required functions in the uploaded solution, as I haven't implemented the driver code.**
